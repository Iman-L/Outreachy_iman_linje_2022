# Outreachy_iman_linje_2022
As part of my contribution to the Outreachy December 2022 cohort. This repo will contain all the tasks on Moja-global's "Research data sources for carbon sequestration in forests" project.
<h3>Why climate change project?</h3>
<p>The impact of climate change on public health is unheard-of when people discuss climate and environmental issues. I am more interested in discovering and finding solutions to how we can fight climate change and reduce the effects it has on our health.</p>
<p>As a veterinary student, with an interest in One Health(an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimise the health of people, animals and the environment), global climatic changes, such as greenhouse gases, global warming and ozone depletion, pose a threat to the sustainability of the environment, which is a threat to humans and animals as well. The mean temperature will rise to 5째C, the water body levels will rise by 1 m in the next 100 years. We should expect droughts and desertification in the near future. When I think of the effect it will have on the world economy, animal welfare and human health in general, I feel that it's time to take action and combat the greenhouse effect. It's possible! By participating in this project, I can contribute my expertise to solving one of the most pressing issues of our time.</p>
<h3>Environmental effects of climate change</h3>
<p>The consumption of fossil fuels has contributed to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. In 2022, Europe recorded its hottest summer, on average 0.8째C hotter than in 2018 for August and 0.4째C hotter than in 2021 for summer.</p>
<p>In August 2022, temperatures were 0.3째C higher than the average for the years 1991 to 2020, the highest they had ever been.</p>
<p>Another environmental disruption that may have an impact on many people's health is ozone depletion. The presence of ozone shields humans from UV radiation, which can damage proteins and DNA, effectively ending life as we know it.</p>
<h3>The impact of climate change in Malawi can be divided into 4 categories</h3>
<ol>
<li>On health; due to floods and droughts the country suffers from chronic diseases such as malaria, cholera etc. High infant mortality associated with malnutrition is rampant.</li>  
<li>Socio-Economic impact; Malawi mainly depends on rainfed agriculture and climate change is a huge burden to the economy as there is little to no use of machinery and irrigation technologies.</li>
<li>Access to water; in recent years Malawi has faced a water crisis as the country relies on rainfall recharge water bodies.</li>
<li>Migration; people are moving out of Malawi. For example Cyclone Gombe brought heavy rains of more than 100 mm in 24 hours, flooding areas in the Southern Region causing severe disruption to transport and displacement of a large population.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Climate change mitigation and adaptation methods</h3>
<li>A farmer should switch to irrigating because it is the most sustainable and has a lower soil erosion rate.</li>
<li>Civic education should be the number one solution as many are not aware of the impact of climate change.</li>
<li>On a global level, we should shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.</li>
